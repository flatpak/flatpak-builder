Major changes in 0.99.1
=======================

In preparation for 1.0, this release depends on a recent (0.11.8) flatpak.

 * New libdir build option
 * Support loading default options from sdk
 * Add support for overriding c/cpp/ld/etc flags in a module
 * Now uses libcurl to download things instead of soup,
   which means we now support ftp urls.
 * Don't prune build caches when building with --{export,finish}-only

 * archive sources support dest-filename
 * archive and file sources now support mirror-urls to list
   extra urls in case of network problems.

Major changes in 0.10.10
========================

 * We now support yaml manifest as well as json.
 * New source type "svn" to download subversion checkouts.
 * New source type "dir" for local directories.
 * Set FLATPAK_BUILDER_N_JOBS in environment during build.
 * If not using ccache, enfore it of. This helps builds with
   meson as they pick up ccache by default, which makes no
   sense when there is no persistent storage for ccache to use.
 * New options prepend-*-path similar to the existing append-*-path
   ones, but prepending instead.
 * New argument --no-shallow-clone which disables any shallow clone
   optimizations.
 * New inherit-sdk-extensions property similar to inherit-extensions,
   but is not inherited in the platform.
 * We now ignore json keys starting with "//" and "__" allowing these
   to be used for comments.
 * Fixed a bug that caused --install to not work properly.
 * New argument --extension-tag for using the new tagged extension feature.
 * The build metadata now records which extensions were produced as part
   of a build.
 * New property add-build-extensions allows creating exension points that
   can be used during the build.

   allowing it to work when building runtimes.

=======================

 * Support -y argument, which passes it on to flatpak install, etc
 * Fix build on glibc 2.27

Major changes in 0.10.8
=======================

 * Fix build on recent glibc

Major changes in 0.10.7
=======================

 * Add support for --socket=fallback-x11
 * Fix assert in --install
 * Fix --disable-updates for git sources
 * When mirroring git repos, use a temporary download dir

Major changes in 0.10.6
=======================

 * New checksum types for file/archive sources: md5, sha1, sha512
 * Support including source snippets from another file, similar to
   how module includes are supported.
 * The app id renaming in the appdata file is now more careful to
   avoid renaming other parts.
 * The cache default repo format for new caches is now bare-user-only
   which means building with flatpak-builder works on filesystems that
   don't support xattrs.
 * New --install argument will install the finished build using the
   new flatpak install install-directly-from-local-repo feature.
   This makes it easier to test local builds.

=======================

 * Add support for running tests during the build (disable with --disable-tests).

   back to cloning the entire remote.

Major changes in 0.10.1

   option is specified.
 * Appstream files called .metainfo.xml are now recognized.

   the platform.

   a lot less space.

   allows per-arch make flags.
