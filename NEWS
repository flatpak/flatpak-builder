Changes in 1.2.2
================

This is a security update to resolve CVE-2022-21682.
Upgrading both Flatpak and flatpak-builder is required.

CVE-2022-21682 is a vulnerability in how flatpak-builder uses flatpak,
which can cause `flatpak-builder --mirror-screenshots-url` commands to be
allowed to create directories outside the build directory.

flatpak-builder >= 1.2.2 uses a new option `--nofilesystem=host:reset`
to cancel out filesystem permissions in the application manifest and
overrides. This is only effective when using Flatpak >= 1.12.4, or a
version that has a backport of the `--nofilesystem=host:reset` feature
(such as 1.10.x versions >= 1.10.7).

When using an older version of Flatpak, this version of flatpak-builder
will still work, but it will show a warning: "Unexpected filesystem
suffix reset, ignoring". In this situation, it is still vulnerable
to CVE-2022-21682.

Other changes:

 * Make FUSE 2 optimizations opt-in.
   By default, this version of flatpak-builder is compatible with versions
   of ostree that have been compiled against either FUSE 2 or FUSE 3.
   Older distributions that use FUSE 2 can configure --with-fuse=2 for better
   performance, but the resulting flatpak-builder executable will not work
   with versions of ostree >= 2022.1 that have been compiled with FUSE 3
   (this is the same behaviour as in 1.2.1).
 * Make the JSON schema introduced in 1.2.1 more complete

Changes in 1.2.1
================
 * Fix debuginfo being re-processed multiple times in a manifest
 * Change manifest parsing issues from warnings to fatal errors
 * Add `.tar.zst` archive support
 * Fix auto-detection of `.7z` archives
 * Install a JSON schema for manifest format
 * Documentation updates

Changes in 1.2.0
================
 * Documentation updates
 * Add missing newlines in some output
 * Fix missing error check in the new inline data support

Changes in 1.1.2
================

 * New secret-opts feature lets you pass e.g. CI secrets into the build.
 * Support content-encoding when downloading.
 * New inline data source allowing easy creation of files from embedded content from
   the manifest.

Changes in 1.1.1
================

This is the first unstable relase in preparation for 1.2.0

 * We now use the external debugedit project instead of using an internal copy.
   The system version can be used, or if not an internal version is used
   built using git submodules.
   Note, this needs libdw 0.172, which may not be available on older distributions.

Changes in 1.0.14
=================

 * Ensure that sources cannot create files outside the build directory.
 * If --sandbox is enabled, ensure sources can't real files outside the
   manifest directory.

Changes in 1.0.13
=================

 * Fix a bug where git submodules were bundled even when disabled (whereas in
   the previous release this issue was fixed for the extraction phase)
 * For bundled extensions, use the specified version as the branch rather than
   using the branch of the parent app

Changes in 1.0.12
=================

 * Make --run work if manifest has --metadata in build-finish
 * Don't try to extract git submodules if they were disabled

Changes in 1.0.11
=================

 * Use brz instead of bzr fom bzr repos (if available)
 * Fix `run-tests` with --sandbox and empty test-args

Changes in 1.0.6
================

 * Pass --noninteractive when installing for flatpak >= 1.2.0
 * Doc fixes

Changes in 1.0.5
================

Due to a change in the output of "flatpak info" the support for
loading default build options from the sdk regressed with flatpak
1.2.x. This is fixed and everyone who built flatpaks with 1.2.x are
recommended to update to this release and re-build.

Changes in 1.0.4
================

 * Add --add/remove-tag options
 * Allow using a full ref as sdk and use the branch from that.

   the host, as the host might not have a new enough appstream-glib.
 * Fix build cache when a module has uncommon characters in the name.

In preparation for 1.0, this release depends on a recent (0.11.8) flatpak.

 * New libdir build option
 * Support loading default options from sdk
 * Add support for overriding c/cpp/ld/etc flags in a module
 * Now uses libcurl to download things instead of soup,
   which means we now support ftp urls.
 * Don't prune build caches when building with --{export,finish}-only
 * rename-desktop-file now handles launchables in the appdata
 * archive sources support dest-filename
 * archive and file sources now support mirror-urls to list
   extra urls in case of network problems.

Major changes in 0.10.10
========================

 * We now support yaml manifest as well as json.
 * New source type "svn" to download subversion checkouts.
 * New source type "dir" for local directories.
 * Set FLATPAK_BUILDER_N_JOBS in environment during build.
 * If not using ccache, enfore it of. This helps builds with
   meson as they pick up ccache by default, which makes no
   sense when there is no persistent storage for ccache to use.
 * New options prepend-*-path similar to the existing append-*-path
   ones, but prepending instead.
 * New argument --no-shallow-clone which disables any shallow clone
   optimizations.
 * New inherit-sdk-extensions property similar to inherit-extensions,
   but is not inherited in the platform.
 * We now ignore json keys starting with "//" and "__" allowing these
   to be used for comments.
 * Fixed a bug that caused --install to not work properly.
 * New argument --extension-tag for using the new tagged extension feature.
 * The build metadata now records which extensions were produced as part
   of a build.

   allowing it to work when building runtimes.

Major changes in 0.10.7
=======================

 * Add support for --socket=fallback-x11
 * Fix assert in --install
 * Fix --disable-updates for git sources

=======================

 * New checksum types for file/archive sources: md5, sha1, sha512
 * Support including source snippets from another file, similar to
   how module includes are supported.
 * The app id renaming in the appdata file is now more careful to
   avoid renaming other parts.
 * The cache default repo format for new caches is now bare-user-only
   which means building with flatpak-builder works on filesystems that
   don't support xattrs.
 * New --install argument will install the finished build using the
   new flatpak install install-directly-from-local-repo feature.
   This makes it easier to test local builds.

=======================

 * Add support for running tests during the build (disable with --disable-tests).

 * Allow git sources to use "HEAD" branch
 * Fixed crashes in some cases of git failure

Major changes in 0.10.3

   is less than 1.8.3.2.

Major changes in 0.10.2
=======================

 * Even more fixes for shallow git clones with older versions of git
 * New property for git sources, disable-shallow-clone which falls
   back to cloning the entire remote.

Major changes in 0.10.1
=======================

 * Fix handling of shallow git clones with older versions of git
 * Fix issue where flatpak-builder --run could exit if some
   thread in the parent process exited, exposeb by e.g.
   gnome-builder.

 * New property: appdata-license lets you easily modify the appstream license field
 * New source type "extra-data" which makes it easier to use extra-data apps
 * We now automatically compress debuginfo unless the no-debuginfo-compression
   option is specified.
 * Appstream files called .metainfo.xml are now recognized.
 * New prepare-platform-commands property, similar to cleanup-platform-commands,
   but run before importing all the changes from the SDK.

   the platform.

   a lot less space.

   allows per-arch make flags.

Skipped 0.9.10 to sync with flatpakk

 * Fix build on some arches due to lack of flatpak_get_kernel_arch symbol
 * Disable ostree 3% free space check for build cache
 * Add some new status terminal title updates
 * Set the requested environment vars in type=shell sources commands
 * Add append-path and append-ld-library-path build options
